#  Knicks to Benefit from 2018 NBA Draft Picks

Though the New York Knicks did not make the playoffs this year, they are in a good place for the future. The team has two first-round draft picks in the 2018 NBA draft and two second-round draft picks. This gives them plenty of opportunities to improve their roster.

The Knicks will likely select Michael Porter Jr. with their first-round pick. Porter is a 6’10” small forward who is considered one of the most talented players in the draft. He played one year at Missouri, where he averaged 16.1 points and 7.6 rebounds per game.

With their second-round pick, the Knicks are likely to select center Mitchell Robinson. Robinson is a 7’0” center who was once considered a top prospect, but he withdrew from college and has not played competitively in over a year. However, he is still very talented and could be a great player for the Knicks if he reaches his potential.

The Knicks also have veterans like Kristaps Porzingis, Tim Hardaway Jr., Courtney Lee, and Enes Kanter on their roster. This gives them some stability heading into next season and allows them to focus on developing their young players.

The Knicks are likely to make some big changes in the offseason, but they appear to be headed in the right direction. They have a promising young core and two first-round draft picks this year, which should help them improve their roster going forward.

#  Kristaps Porzingis Extension Shows Faith in the Future of the Knicks

The New York Knicks announced today that they have agreed to a contract extension with power forward Kristaps Porzingis. The extension is for five years and $150 million, locking up the 21-year-old for his prime years.

This was a big decision for the Knicks, who have been rebuilding since their last playoff appearance in 2013. Many people saw Porzingis as their best hope for the future and were worried that he might leave in free agency next summer. But now it appears that the Knicks believe in their young core and are willing to invest in them.

Porzingis had an impressive sophomore season, averaging 18.1 points and 7.2 rebounds per game while shooting 36 percent from three-point range. He has already shown signs of becoming a dominant force in the NBA, and with this new extension he will be paid like one.

This is a risky move by the Knicks, but it could pay off big time if Porzingis continues to develop into one of the league's top players. They now have him under contract through the 2022-23 season, when he will be only 26 years old.

There is no guarantee that the Knicks will make the playoffs during that time, but at least they know that they have a foundation built around Porzingis that they can continue to build on. And if things go really well, they could even be contenders for an NBA championship in a few years.

The signing of this extension indicates faith in the future of the New York Knicks, and fans should be excited about what this young team can accomplish together.

#  New York Knicks Poised for a Bright Future

The New York Knicks finished the 2017-2018 season with a record of 29-53, good for 12th place in the Eastern Conference. This was a step back from their previous season where they finished with a record of 31-51, which was good enough for 10th place in the East.

Despite this, there are many reasons to be excited about the Knicks' future. Here are four reasons why:

1) The arrival of rookie point guard Frank Ntilikina.

Ntilikina was drafted with the 8th overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft and has already proven himself to be a valuable player. He averaged 5.9 points, 3.2 assists, and 2.3 rebounds per game during his rookie season and is expected to only improve in future seasons.

2) The development of Kristaps Porzingis.

Porzingis has emerged as one of the brightest young stars in the league. He averaged 22.7 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 2.4 blocks per game last season and appears poised to take even more steps forward in future seasons.

3) The signing of Tim Hardaway Jr.

Hardaway Jr. was signed by the Knicks prior to the start of last season and ended up being one of their most productive players. He averaged 17.5 points per game while shooting 37% from three-point range. His addition will be key for the Knicks as they look to climb up the standings in future seasons.

4) The hiring of David Fizdale as head coach.
Fizdale is a well-respected coach who has previously coached teams such as the Miami Heat and Memphis Grizzlies. He is known for his offensive creativity and his ability to get the best out of his players. This should benefit both Porzingis and Ntilikina moving forward.

#  Carmelo Anthony Trade Opens Doors for Younger Players on Knicks

The Carmelo Anthony trade reopened opportunities for younger Knicks players. Courtney Lee, Doug McDermott, and Kristaps Porzingis have taken on more significant roles with the departure of Anthony.

Lee is averaging 11.7 points per game this season, up from 9.6 last year. McDermott is averaging 10.2 points per game, up from 4.5 last year. Porzingis is averaging 24.3 points per game, up from 18.1 last year.

The trade has allowed the Knicks to develop their younger players in bigger roles. It has also allowed them to add young talent through the draft. The Knicks drafted Frank Ntilikina with the eighth overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft. They also drafted Kevin Knox with the ninth overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft.

The Knicks are hoping that Ntilikina and Knox can develop into stars in the NBA. They are also hoping that Lee, McDermott, and Porzingis can continue to develop and improve their play.

#  Despite Early Struggles, Knicks Fans Have Plenty to be Optimistic About

The Knicks had a rough start to the season, but things are starting to look up.

Here are four reasons why Knicks fans should be optimistic:

1. The Knicks have one of the best defenses in the NBA.

2. Kristaps Porzingis is playing at an All-Star level.

3. The Knicks have a deep and talented roster.

4. The Eastern Conference is wide open this year.

The Knicks have the potential to make a run in the playoffs if they can get their offense going.
