#  How can you tell if you have a gas leak in your home?

If you suspect a gas leak in your home, there are several key things you can do to help determine whether or not one exists. First and foremost, be aware of the signs and symptoms of a gas leak. These can include a strong odor like sulfur or rotten eggs, sparks or flames coming from appliances, excessive condensation on windows or pipes, and blowsickness. If you notice any of these signs, leave your home immediately and call the gas company.

You can also perform a few simple tests to see if you have a gas leak. One is to check your pilot light. If it's out, there may be an issue with the gas line. Another test is to soapy water test leaks in your plumbing system. To do this, mix ½ teaspoon of dishwashing soap into 1 quart of warm water. Then use a spray bottle to apply the soapy water to all outdoor faucets, connections, and valves. Turn on each faucet for about two minutes. If bubbles form, there's likely a gas leak present.

If you still can't determine whether you have a gas leak or not, it's best to call a professional plumber or the gas company for assistance.

#  How do you properly test for a gas leak?

The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has outlined five steps that should be taken when testing for a gas leak: 

1. Determine the location of the gas leak.
2. Turn off the gas supply to the affected area.
3. Clear the area of people and pets.
4. Test for gas leaks using an approved detector.
5. If a gas leak is detected, call 9-1-1 immediately.

#  What are some common signs of a gas leak?

If you think you might have a gas leak in your home, there are some common signs to look for:

1. A strong odor of natural or propane gas.

2. Dead plants near the gas meter or compressor.

3. Pilot lights that regularly go out on appliances.

4. Unusual sounds such as hissing, whistling or roaring from a gas appliance or pipes.

5. Flames or sparks coming from appliances, wiring or fixtures.

6. Increased water heater bills - often due to a leaking water heater igniting the gas fumes and causing the water heater to run more often than normal.

#  How do you fix a gas leak?

Fixing a gas leak is a potentially dangerous but necessary task. There are several ways to approach it, so it’s important to know the right steps to take.

If you smell gas, leave the area and call your local utility company or emergency services. Do not try to fix the leak yourself.
