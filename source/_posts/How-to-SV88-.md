#  Detroit Tigers 

The Detroit Tigers are a professional baseball team based in Detroit, Michigan. The Tigers compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) Central division. One of the AL's eight charter franchises, the club was founded in Detroit in 1894 as part of the Western League.

The club moved to Bristol, Connecticut, in 1900 and played four seasons there as the Bristol Tigers. It then became one of the AL's eight original franchises when the American League split from the National League in 1901. The team continued to play at Bennett Park until moving to Tiger Stadium in 1912. They were known as the "Tigers" from 1903 to 1924, after which they became the "Detroit Lions". 

The club reverted to the "Tigers" name in 1946. They currently play their home games at Comerica Park in Downtown Detroit. The Tigers constructed Bennett Park with a capacity of 12,000, which was increased to 18,000 by 1914. It was replaced by Tiger Stadium in 1961, which was expanded to accommodate 38,000 people. The Tigers played their first game at Comerica Park on April 11, 2000; a 6–3 win over the Kansas City Royals.

In 1911, owner Frank Navin hired Hughie Jennings as manager. Under Jennings, 1911-1919, the Tigers never lost more than 73 games and won consecutive pennants in 1907 and 1908. In 1915, Ty Cobb became manager of the team and held that position for 22 seasons through 1926. During Cobb's tenure as manager, the team won four World Series titles (1907, 1908, 1909 and 1924). Most notably however, is that Cobb still holds many MLB managerial records including most career wins (2189), most wins with a single team (2189), most winning seasons (24), most strikeouts by a batter (4191), most hits by a batter (4406) and highest batting average (.366). 

Cobb also led all players in his era or before him in stolen bases (892). After managing for two years without winning a pennant or appearing in a World Series following Cobb's departure before retiring himself, Mickey Cochrane was brought back as manager for 1934 season and led them to another championship that year against Cardinals Cardinals with an injured Dizzy Dean unable to start Game 7 due his injury suffered days earlier where he pitched 5 innings completing game one then pitching again 4 days later on 3 days’ rest for dramatic win forcing Cards starting Frisch who relieved Diz leading also game six over 6 innings final 7-5 decisions series ending an epic duel preventing Cards win streak reach 10–0′′ World series resulting rematch beating Yankees 4 games to 0 becoming 1934 champions teammates Alley heroics Enos Slaughter throwing cutoff man stranded third base Yogi Berra 8th-inning Curly Wig managed successor Joe Cronin general Bill DeWitt Jr.'s father Cornelius became owner Dave Dombrowski president CEO Al Avila GM 2nd stint Mike Ilitch died February 10 2017 son Christopher Ilitch becomes controlling owner 

The Tigers have had 42 different players represented on 25 different All-Star teams including six players who have been elected into Baseball Hall of Fame: Ty Cobb (inducted 1936), Hank Greenberg (inducted 1956), Hal Newhouser (inducted 1965), Charlie Gehringer (inducted 1948), Mickey Cochrane (inducted 1967), and Al Kaline (inducted 1980). 30 members of the Detroit Tigers organization have been inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame including former Manager Hughie Jennings and current broadcaster Ernie Harwell. 

On November 3rd 1987 Former Owner Mike Ilitch purchased The Detroit Red Wings NHL Franchise followed by purchasing The Detroit Tigers Franchise on December 10th 1992from fellow pizza mogul William Clay Ford Sr.. In March 2013 Forbes Magazine estimated the value of The Detroit Tigers at $350 million making it number 17 on their list of most valuable sports teams in America but slid down 19 spots to 36th on their 2017 list with an estimated value at $1 billion dollars 
Ownership has made it clear they will spare no expense when it comes time to put a winning product on the field; whether that means spending money on big name free agents like Prince Fielder or Justin Verlander or signing homegrown talents like Miguel Cabrera long term contracts – they are committed to winning Championships for Motor City!

#  Nietz 

The Nietzche school of thought, which is also sometimes referred to as post-modernism, is a philosophical approach that emphasizes individual freedom and creativity. It explores the human condition and the meaning of existence, often in a negative light.

Supporters of this thinking approach believe that humans are limited by their own abilities and that existence has no inherent meaning. Life is therefore an open ended process that must be created by the individual. This means that people must find their own way in life and define their own values.

Nietzsche believed that humans were evolving into a new form of being, one that was stronger and more capable than those who had come before. He called this idea the ubermensch or superman. This person is someone who is not bound by traditional morality or conventions, but who instead creates their own values and lives according to their own desires.

While Nietzsche's philosophy can be seen as pessimistic, it also offers a great deal of freedom and potential for self-expression. It encourages people to reject outdated norms and create their own unique paths in life.
