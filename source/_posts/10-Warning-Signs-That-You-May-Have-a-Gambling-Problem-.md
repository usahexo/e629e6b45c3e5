#  10 Warning Signs That You May Have a Gambling Problem 

If you have a problem with gambling, it can be tough to admit it. After all, who wants to think of themselves as an addict? However, if you display any of the following behaviors, there’s a good chance that you have a gambling problem and should consider seeking help.

1. You can't resist the urge to gamble

This is probably the most obvious sign that you have a problem with gambling. If you find yourself constantly thinking about gambling and feel like you can't resist the urge to do it, then you definitely have a problem.

2. You're hiding your gambling from loved ones

If you're trying to keep your gambling activities a secret, that's another sign that there's something wrong. Gambling should be something that you're open and honest about, not something you try to hide from the people closest to you.

3. You'm spending more money on gambling than you can afford

If your gambling is costing you more money than you can afford to lose, then it's definitely a problem. When gambling starts impacting your day-to-day life in a negative way, it's time to seek help.

4. You're betting more money than ever before

If the amount of money you're betting on games is increasing over time, that's another clear sign that there's a problem. If you can't seem to stop increasing the stakes, then there's definitely an issue here that needs to be addressed.

5. You're lying about your gambling losses

Lying about how much money you've lost while gambling is not only dishonest, but it's also another clear sign that there's something wrong. If you feel like you need to hide your gambling losses from others, then that's definitely not a good sign.

* Do you find yourself thinking about gambling all the time?

* Are you unable to resist gambling, even when you know it’s bad for you?

* Do you gamble more than you intended to or can afford?

* Have your relationships been negatively affected by your gambling?

* Have you lied or stolen to fund your gambling habit?

* Do you feel depressed or anxious about your gambling?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then there’s a good chance that gambling is ruining your life. If you want to get back on track, seek help from a professional. There are many addiction treatment options available, so don’t be afraid to ask for help.

#  6 Signs You Might Have a Gambling Problem 

 gambling addiction is a very real problem that impacts many people in the United States. While most people can enjoy gambling without any issues, for others it can quickly become a problem. If you are worried that you or someone you love might have a gambling problem, look for these six signs.

1. Feeling like you have to gamble to feel normal

If you feel an intense need to gamble in order to feel okay, this is definitely a sign of a potential problem. When you become dependent on gambling, your life starts to revolve around it and that's not healthy.

2. Lying about how much money or time you've spent gambling

Another sign that there might be a problem is when you start to lie about how much money or time you've been spending on gambling. This could be because you're ashamed of how much money you've lost or because you don't want others to know how much time you're spending on this activity.

3. Experiencing mood swings after gambling

If you find yourself feeling really good after winning at gambling, but then feeling down and upset after losing, this is another sign that there might be a problem. The highs and lows associated with gambling can be really damaging to your well-being and your mental health.

4. Gambling more than intended or budgeted for

If you find yourself regularly spending more money on gambling than intended or budgeted for, this is definitely a sign of trouble. When your spending on gambling starts to negatively impact other areas of your life, such as your finances or your relationships, it's definitely time to seek help.
