#  When would gambling become legal in Annapolis? 

This is a question that has been debated in Annapolis for years. Gambling has been illegal in the state for over a century, but there have been multiple attempts to legalize it in recent years. 

Supporters of gambling argue that it could bring much-needed revenue to the state. They point to casinos in other states, which generate billions of dollars in revenue each year. Opponents of gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to social ills. 

The most recent attempt to legalize gambling in Maryland was a bill introduced by Senator Thomas McLain “Mac” Middleton in 2017. The bill would have legalized slot machines at five locations in the state, including at Arundel Mills Mall and National Harbor. The bill did not make it out of committee. 

There is likely to be another attempt to legalize gambling in the next legislative session. It will be interesting to see whether there is more support for legalization this time around.

#  Mayor proposes gambling legislation 

Boston, MA - Mayor Marty Walsh proposed new legislation today that would allow gambling in the city. The legislation would establish 3 gambling venues, which would include a casino, a race track with slots, and a poker room.

Mayor Walsh believes that the new venues will bring jobs and revenue to the city. "This is a great opportunity for Boston," said Walsh. "The gambling venues will create thousands of jobs and bring in millions of dollars in revenue."

Opponents of the proposal say that gambling can be addictive and harmful to people's health. They also argue that the venues will bring crime and negative social effects to the city.

The City Council will hold a hearing on the proposal in the coming weeks.

#  Gambling expansion could bring millions to Annapolis 

The legalization of gambling in Maryland could bring millions of dollars to the city of Annapolis, according to a report released by the city’s comptroller. 

Doug Mayer, a spokesman for Republican Governor Larry Hogan, said the governor plans to carefully review the report. “Governor Hogan has been clear that he would veto any expanded gambling bill that comes to his desk,” Mayer said. 

The city’s comptroller projects that an expansion of gambling in Maryland could generate $15 million for the city annually. The money would go toward tourism and economic development initiatives in Annapolis. 

Republican Delegate Herb McMillan, who represents the district that includes Annapolis, said he is supportive of legalizing some forms of gambling in Maryland. McMillan cited estimates from the state gaming commission that suggest legalized gambling could generate as much as $500 million in annual revenue for the state. 

Opposition to expanded gambling remains strong, however. The Rev. Frank Reid III, pastor of Bethel AME Church in Baltimore and a leading opponent of legalized gambling, called the comptroller’s report “misleading at best and fraudulent at worst.” Reid said any money generated by expanded gambling would come at the expense of social programs and working-class people who can least afford it.

#  New bill could legalize gambling in Annapolis 

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) — A new bill in the Maryland General Assembly could legalize gambling in Annapolis.

The proposed legislation would allow Anne Arundel County to operate a casino and two satellite casinos.

It’s been more than a year since MGM slots were removed from the state’s five racetracks. Supporters say the new bill would help make up for that loss of revenue.

 opponents say it would contribute to an already growing problem with gambling addiction.

“This is really an attempt to legalize casino gambling in Maryland, something that the voters have repeatedly rejected,” said Delegate Kumar Barve, D-Montgomery County.

# Annapolis closer to legalizing gambling

The Maryland capital is one step closer to legalizing gambling after the state’s Senate passed a bill on Thursday authorizing a casino in the city.

If the House of Delegates also approves the measure, as expected, the casino would be developed by MGM Resorts International and operated by Penn National Gaming.

The casino would be built at Arundel Mills mall, near Baltimore-Washington International Airport.

Supporters of the measure say it would create jobs and generate revenue for the state, while opponents argue that it would lead to increased crime and social problems.
