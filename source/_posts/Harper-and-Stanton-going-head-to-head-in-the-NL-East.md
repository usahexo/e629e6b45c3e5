#  Harper and Stanton going head-to-head in the NL East

One of the most exciting things to watch in baseball this year is the Harper-Stanton show going on in the NL East. The two powerhouses are both gunning for the division title, and it's been a blast to watch them compete.

So far, Harper has been the better player, with a batting average of .322 to Stanton's .279. He's also got more home runs (27 to 22) and stolen bases (13 to 7). Harper has also been more consistent, with an on-base percentage of .415 compared to Stanton's .353.

Clearly, Harper has the edge so far this season. But don't count Stanton out - he's a fierce competitor who will do everything he can to win. The rest of the season should be very exciting!

#  Mets and Nationals slugging it out for the National League East

The Mets and Nationals are slugging it out for the National League East. The Nationals are in first place, but the Mets are hot on their heels.

The Nationals have a powerful lineup, with players like Bryce Harper and Anthony Rendon. However, the Mets have some powerful hitters of their own, including Yoenis Cespedes and Jay Bruce.

Both teams have good pitching staffs too. The Nationals have Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg, while the Mets have Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard.

It should be an exciting race to the finish line. Whoever wins the National League East will be a strong contender for the World Series.

#  Braves hope to contend in National League East

The Atlanta Braves were one of the busiest teams in baseball this offseason. They made a few big acquisitions, including outfielder Justin Upton and first baseman Freddie Freeman. They also signed starting pitcher Ervin Santana to a long-term contract.

The Braves are hoping that these moves will help them contend for the National League East division title this season. The Nationals are the favorites to win the division, but the Braves believe they have what it takes to win it.

The Braves had a good season last year, finishing with a record of 96-66. However, they were unable to beat the Nationals in the playoffs and were eliminated in four games.

This year, they are hoping to make it further into the playoffs and compete for the World Series. The addition of Justin Upton gives them one of the best outfields in baseball. He joins fellow outfielders Jason Heyward and BJ Upton.

First baseman Freddie Freeman is also one of the best players on the team. He hit .319 with 23 home runs last year. He will be relied on heavily this season to produce runs for the Braves.

Starting pitcher Ervin Santana was also a big acquisition for the Braves this offseason. He has been a consistent starter throughout his career and is coming off of a good year with the Kansas City Royals.

The Braves have talent and are hoping that their new additions will help them win the National League East division this season. It will be tough to unseat the Nationals, but if anyone can do it, itâ€™s Atlanta.

#  Phillies aiming to rebuild in National League East

The Phillies have been in rebuild mode for a few years now and they seem to be trending in the right direction. They are in position to make the playoffs this year and they have a bright future ahead of them.

The Phillies have one of the best farm systems in baseball. They have a lot of young talent that is ready to contribute at the big league level. This year, they will be relying on players like Aaron Nola, Rhys Hoskins, and Odubel Herrera to lead them to victory.

The National League East is wide open this year. The Braves are expected to compete for the division title, but the Phillies have a chance to win it if they play up to their potential. The Mets and Nationals are both struggling this year, so the door is open for the Phillies to make a run at the division title.

The Phillies have made some shrewd moves over the past few years. They traded away some of their veteran players for young prospects who can help them win in the future. They also signed some high-priced free agents like Jake Arrieta and Carlos Santana this past offseason.

This year, the Phillies will be wearing brand new uniforms. They are changing their logo and uniforms for the first time since 1975. The new uniforms are inspired by their history and they feature a classic look that fans are sure to love.

The Phillies are poised for success in the near future. They have a talented roster and they are playing in a weak division. If they continue to develop their young players, they could reach the playoffs as soon as next year.
