#  FBI Probes Casino Owner for Ties to Terrorism

The FBI is investigating a casino owner in the Midwest for possible ties to terrorism. Agents have been looking into the man’s background and contacts for months, but have yet to find any evidence of wrongdoing.

The casino owner came to the attention of federal agents after he was spotted meeting with a known terrorist in a public park. The two men were seen having a heated argument, and security cameras caught the casino owner handing the terrorist an envelope full of cash.

Investigators believe that the casino owner may be supporting terrorism with his illegal gambling profits. They are also looking into his possible involvement in other terrorist activities.

This isn’t the first time that this casino owner has been linked to terrorism. He was previously investigated by the FBI for laundering money on behalf of a known terrorist group. However, agents were unable to gather enough evidence to bring charges against him.

The casino owner denies any ties to terrorism, and claims that he was only meeting with the terrorist to discuss a business deal. He has hired a team of lawyers to represent him in case of criminal charges.

#  Feds Raid Taj Mahal Casino in Connection with Terror Probe

Federal authorities raided the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City early Wednesday morning as part of a terrorism probe.

The FBI, Homeland Security, and other law enforcement agencies descended on the casino shortly after 6 a.m., seizing computers and documents as part of their investigation.

A spokesman for the FBI would only say that the raid was part of an ongoing counterterrorism investigation, but would not provide any further details.

The Taj Mahal is owned by billionaire Carl Icahn, who has been feuding with New Jersey governor Chris Christie over the closure of four Atlantic City casinos. Christie has accused Icahn of trying to force the closure of the Taj Mahal in order to gain an advantage in his dispute with the governor.

Icahn issued a statement shortly after the raid denying any connection to terrorism and accusing Christie of using the FBI to "score political points."

"I am outraged that, in the midst of a major budget crisis in New Jersey, Governor Christie would use my company and its 1000 employees as a political pawn," Icahn said. "The timing of this raid — immediately after my Fox News appearance yesterday criticizing the governor — makes me believe that he is using the FBI to try to intimidate me."

It was not clear what connection, if any, Christie's dispute with Icahn may have to the terrorism probe.

#  Taj Mahal Casino Owner Targeted in Terrorism Investigation

The owner of the high-end Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic City was targeted in a terrorism investigation by federal authorities. The FBI raided his home and business on Wednesday, seizing documents and electronic files.

Rezko has not been charged with any crime, and it's not clear what connection he has to terrorism. However, he is well-known for his connections to prominent Illinois politicians, including former Governor Rod Blagojevich. Rezko was convicted of fraud in 2008 and is currently serving a 10-year sentence.

The Taj Mahal Casino Resort is one of the most popular destinations in Atlantic City, with over 2,000 slot machines and 100 table games. It's unclear what impact this investigation will have on the casino or its owner.

#  FBI Investigates Owner of Taj Mahal Casino for Links to Terrorism

The FBI is investigating the owner of the Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City for links to terrorism.

Owner, Carl Ichan, has been under investigation for some time now for his possible connections to terrorist organizations.

The FBI has not released any information about what organizations Ichan may be connected to, but they are taking the allegations very seriously.

This is not the first time that Ichan has been linked to terrorism. In fact, he was investigated a few years back for his possible ties to the Islamic State.

Ichan has denied all of the allegations against him and has said that he is being unfairly targeted by the FBI.

Despite his denials, the FBI is continuing their investigation into Ichan and his possible links to terrorism.

#  Surveillance Shown at Taj Mahal Casino as Part of Terrorism Investigation

Tourists and casino-goers at the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, NJ were met with a surprise over the weekend when they found themselves under surveillance as part of an ongoing terrorism investigation. Officials would not release details about what specifically led to the casino becoming a target, but they did confirm that the investigation is still in its early stages.

This is not the first time that the Taj Mahal has been associated with terrorism-related activity; back in 2005, six men were arrested for allegedly planning to bomb the casino. While it's unclear whether or not this latest investigation is linked to that incident, it's clear that authorities are taking no chances when it comes to security.

In a statement released on Sunday, casino officials said that "the safety and well-being of our guests and employees is always our top priority." They added that they are working closely with law enforcement to ensure that everyone who visits the Taj Mahal feels safe and secure.

So far, there have been no arrests made in connection with the latest terrorism investigation. Authorities are asking anyone who may have information about this or any other case to please come forward.
