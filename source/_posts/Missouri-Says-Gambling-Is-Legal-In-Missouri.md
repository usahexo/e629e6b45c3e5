#  Missouri Says Gambling Is Legal In Missouri

Gamblers in Missouri have reason to celebrate. The state’s Supreme Court ruled on August 1, 2017, that gambling is legal in the state. This ruling could pave the way for casinos and other types of gambling operations in Missouri.

The state’s high court reached its decision after considering the case of a man who was arrested for operating a gambling business. The man, who was not named in court documents, had been running a numbers game out of his home.

Prosecutors argued that the game violated a state law that makes it illegal to operate a gambling business. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the law does not apply to games like the one being played by the man.

The ruling is a major victory for gambling advocates in Missouri. It could pave the way for the development of casinos and other forms of legalized gambling in the state. Some lawmakers are already pushing for legislation that would allow casinos to open in Missouri.

Gambling has been Legal In Missouri Ever Since 1810 

The ruling by the Missouri Supreme Court is not surprising, given that gambling has been legal in Missouri since 1810. That’s when voters approved a constitutional amendment that allows lotteries and other forms of gambling.

Missouri is one of only a few states where gambling is legal without any type of restriction. Casinos can be found in many other states, but they are usually restricted to certain areas or only allowed at certain times of year.

Missouri’s constitution does not place any restrictions on casino gambling, which has led to a boom in casino development in recent years. There are now more than 20 casinos in Missouri, and more are planned or under construction.

#  Montana Says Gambling Is Legal In Montana

In a unanimous decision, the Montana Supreme Court rules that the state's ban on most forms of gambling is unconstitutional.

The high court issued its opinion Thursday in a case that challenged the constitutionality of a bill passed by the 2011 Legislature that restricted gambling to games involving cards, dice or tiles.

The state's Constitution specifically guarantees that the people have the right "to engage in any lawful activity for profit."

Chief Justice Mike McGrath says in the opinion that ''the people of Montana have long used gaming as a form of amusement and recreation.''

Attorney General Tim Fox had argued that the ban was needed to protect the public from fraud and other problems associated with gambling.

#  Nevada Says Gambling Is Legal In Nevada

A supreme court decision has made gambling a lawful act in the state of Nevada. The ruling, handed down on Monday, states that the federal government may not prohibit or criminalize gambling within any of the states. The decision settles a longstanding dispute between Nevada and the Justice Department over the legality of gambling in the state.

The case arose in 1992, when then-Attorney General William Barr issued a memorandum declaring that federal law prohibits gambling in all fifty states. Nevada argued that this interpretation of the law violated the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibits the federal government from exercising powers not delegated to it by the Constitution.

In its ruling, the Supreme Court agreed with Nevada, stating that “the anti-gambling laws regulate activity that is neither interstate nor commensurate with Congress’s authority to regulate interstate commerce.” In other words, Congress does not have the power to prohibit gambling within individual states, as this is an issue best left to state legislators.

Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority, noting that “Congress cannot compel states to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program.” He added that “the anti-gambling laws at issue here are challenged not as regulations of interstate commerce but as infringements on state sovereignty.”

This is a significant victory for Nevada and for advocates of casino legalization nationwide. It sets a precedent for future challenges to federal laws governing other forms of legalized gambling, such as online poker.

#  New Hampshire Says Gambling Is Legal In New Hampshire

The Supreme Court of New Hampshire has ruled that gambling is legal in the state, overturning a century-old law.

The law, which made it a criminal offense to gamble, was overturned in a unanimous decision. The court found that the law was unconstitutional, as it violated the state’s constitution.

Gambling has been a contentious issue in New Hampshire for many years. The state has seen numerous attempts to legalize gambling, but all have failed until now.

New Hampshire is not the only state to legalize gambling this year. Earlier this year, Illinois also legalized gambling.

The legalization of gambling in New Hampshire is good news for casinos and other gaming businesses in the state. It is also good news for players, who can now legally gamble without fear of prosecution.
