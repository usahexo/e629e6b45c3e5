#  Where is the Gambling in Xillia 2?

Xillia 2 is a Role-Playing Game that was developed by Bandai Namco Games and it was originally released in Japan in November of 2014. The game has been met with generally positive reviews, however, some gamers have wondered where the gambling found in the first game title, Xillia, has gone.

In an interview with IGN Japan, the game's director Hiroyuki Kobayashi addressed this issue. According to Kobayashi, the gambling element was removed because they "wanted to focus on telling a more coherent story". He also cited balance concerns as another reason for its removal.

Whether or not you are happy with the decision to remove gambling from Xillia 2, there is no doubt that it will still be a great game. Hopefully we can all look forward to future titles from Bandai Namco Games that will include this feature once again.

#  Gambling in Xillia 2 Adds Excitement to the Game!

Gambling in video games is nothing new, but it has gained in popularity in recent years. Many gamers enjoy the added excitement that comes with betting on virtual outcomes. Some developers have even begun to include gambling mini-games as part of their titles.

The most popular game in the casino is poker. In poker, players are dealt five cards, and must create the best possible hand using any combination of their cards and the cards on the table. The stakes can be high, and some of the better players can walk away with a lot of money.

Other games available at the casino include blackjack, roulette, and slots. All of these games are easy to learn but can be surprisingly challenging to play well. The casino offers a great way for players to make some extra money while they explore the world of Xillia 2.
