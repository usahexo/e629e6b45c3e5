#  North Carolina Slot Machine Winnings Tax Could be Heading Up in the New Year

As 2017 comes to a close, North Carolina lawmakers are gearing up for what is sure to be a contentious debate over the state’s slot machine winnings tax. The current rate is 25%, but some legislators are pushing for a hike to 35%.

The revenue generated by the tax is used to fund education and health care initiatives in the state. Opponents of the increase argue that it will lead to fewer people gambling, and thus will result in less revenue for the government.

Supporters of the increase counter that it is necessary in order to maintain vital services in the state. They also point out that other states with higher taxes on slot machine winnings generate more revenue than North Carolina does.

The debate is sure to continue well into 2018, as legislators from both sides of the issue make their case to their colleagues. In the meantime, players can only wait and see what happens.

#  State Tax Officials Weigh In on North Carolina Slot Machine Winnings

As the North Carolina Legislature debates a proposed change to state law that would allow slot machine gambling, state tax officials are raising questions about how the new revenue source would be taxed.

The change, Senate Bill 792, was introduced by Republican Senators Shirley Randleman and Andrew Brock earlier this year and has been referred to the Senate Finance Committee. If approved, the bill would allow the installation of up to 500 slot machines at each of the state's four horse racing tracks.

According to a report in The Charlotte Observer, state tax officials say they need more information on how the winnings from slot machines would be taxed. "It just doesn't seem like a good idea to us," said David Ruggiero, a manager in the Horses and Gaming division of the North Carolina Department of Revenue. "There are just too many unanswered questions."

Ruggiero told the newspaper that his department is particularly concerned about whether slot machine winnings would be considered taxable income and what kind of documentation would be required to prove such winnings. He also questioned whether the state would be able to collect taxes on out-of-state winnings from people who gamble at North Carolina's racetracks.

Supporters of the bill argue that it would provide a new revenue stream for the cash-strapped state. According to The Charlotte Observer, Randleman said her proposal would generate $40 million annually for the state government. "This is not about gambling," she said. "This is about keeping our horseracing industry alive."



However, opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increases in problem gambling, especially among low-income residents. "It's always easier for someone who is struggling economically to rationalize their losses because they can't afford them in the first place," said Carmen Green, executive director of North Carolina Problem Gambling Services.

#  Is There a North Carolina Slot Machine Winnings Tax?

When it comes to gambling, there are a lot of questions about tax laws. For example, is there a North Carolina slot machine winnings tax? The answer is yes, there is a tax on gambling winnings in North Carolina. This tax is called the “Unlawful Gambling Winnings Tax” and it is calculated at a rate of 5%.

This tax is imposed on any person who wins more than $5,000 playing any type of unlawful game or betting activity. This includes slot machines, blackjack, roulette, and all other casino games. However, it does not include lottery winnings or horse racing winnings.

There are a few exceptions to this rule. If you lose money while gambling, you are not required to report those losses as taxable income. And if you won a jackpot that was paid out over time (i.e., not in one lump sum), then only the portion of the jackpot that was considered taxable income would be subject to the 5% tax.

The Unlawful Gambling Winnings Tax is reported on your state income tax return. You will need to file Form NC-1040NR, Schedule W, and report your gambling winnings on Line 16a.

#  NC Proposes Higher Tax Rate for Slot Machine Winnings

The North Carolina Senate has put forth a proposal that would see the state's tax on slot machine winnings increased from its current rate of 20% to 35%.

Backers of the bill say that the increase is needed in order to help offset the $1.6 billion shortfall that the state is currently facing. In addition, they argue that the increase would help to level the playing field between casinos in North Carolina and those located in other states.

Critics of the measure, however, say that it will do nothing to address the shortfall and that it will only lead to increased taxes on casino players. They also argue that it will give casinos in other states a significant competitive edge over those located in North Carolina.

The bill is currently being considered by the state House of Representatives.

#  How Much is the Tax on Slot Machine Winnings in North Carolina?

Slot machines are a popular way to gamble, and many people enjoy the excitement of winning some money. But how much tax do you have to pay on those winnings in North Carolina?

The answer to that question depends on how much you win. If you win $10 or less, there is no tax on your winnings. If you win more than $10 but less than $600, the tax rate is 5%. If you win more than $600, the tax rate is 7%.

So if you hit the jackpot and take home $1,000 from a slot machine, you'll have to pay $70 in taxes. That's not a bad haul, but it's important to be aware of the taxes that are owed on gambling winnings so that you're not caught off guard.
