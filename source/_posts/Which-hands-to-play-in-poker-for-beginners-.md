# Which hands to play in poker for beginners 

As a beginner in poker, it is important that you understand which hands to play and when to fold. In this article, we will discuss the different types of hands you will encounter in poker, as well as some general tips on how to play them.

The first type of hand you will come across in poker is called a 'flush'. A flush is made up of five cards all of the same suit. For example, if you are holding two clubs and three spades, you have a flush. The ace can be used as either the high card or the low card in a flush, so an Ace-high flush would be the best possible hand. If two players have the same type of flush, then the player with the highest card in their flush will win.

The second type of hand you will come across is called a 'straight'. A straight is made up of five consecutive cards of any suit. So, for example, if you are holding two hearts and three diamonds, you have a straight. If two players have a straight, then the player with the highest card in their straight wins - even if that card is not part of the original five-card sequence.

The third type of hand is called a 'pair'. A pair consists of two cards of the same rank. So, for example, if you are holding two queens, you have a pair. If two players have a pair then the player with the highest pair wins. If both players have pairs then their second-highest cards are compared - and so on until one player has won all the cards.

The fourth type of hand is called 'two pairs'. This consists of two cards of one rank and two cards of another rank - for example, two kings and two sixes. As with other hands, if both players have two pairs then their highest ranking pair decides who wins. If there is still a tie then the next highest ranking pair decides who goes home with the pot - and so on until one player has won all the cards.

Finally, we come to 'the full house'. This is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank - for example, three eights and two jacks. As with other hands, if both players have a full house then their highest ranking triplet (the three matching cards) decides who wins - even if this triplet is not part of their original five-card hand.

# What are the best hands to play in poker? 

There is no definitive answer to this question, as different hands will be better in different situations. However, there are some hands that are generally considered to be more powerful than others.

The most powerful hand in poker is generally considered to be a royal flush - 10, J, Q, K, A of the same suit. This combination is very rare, and it is usually very difficult for your opponents to beat.

Another powerful hand is a straight flush - five consecutive cards of the same suit. This hand is also relatively rare, and can often beat other hands when played properly.

Other strong hands include four of a kind and a full house. These hands can often win against weaker hands when played correctly.

However, it is important to note that not all hands are created equal. Some hands are much weaker than others, and should only be played if there are no better options available. For example, two pairs or three of a kind are typically much weaker than the hands listed above.

If you are unsure about what hand to play, it is always best to consult with a professional poker player or strategy guide. There is no one perfect answer for every situation; however, learning about the different hands and their potential strengths and weaknesses will help you make better decisions while playing poker.

# How to play poker - Which hands should you go for? 

If you're looking to start playing poker, it's important to understand the different hands and when you should be going for them. In this article, we'll take a look at some of the most common hands in poker and give you some tips on how to play them.

One of the most important things to remember when playing poker is that you should always be thinking about your odds and what's likely to happen next. You need to be calculating your chances of winning based on the cards you have and the cards that are still left in the deck.

With that in mind, here are some of the most common hands in poker - and what you should do with them.

Pair: A pair is two cards of the same rank. When you have a pair, you should usually raise or bet as there's a good chance that you'll win the hand.

Three of a kind: A three of a kind is three cards of the same rank. When you have a three of a kind, you should usually raise or bet as there's an even better chance that you'll win the hand.

Straight: A straight is five consecutive cards of different suits. When you have a straight, you should usually raise or bet as there's a good chance that you'll win the hand.

Flush: A flush is five cards of the same suit. When you have a flush, you should usually raise or bet as there's a good chance that you'll win the hand.

Full house: A full house is three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. When you have a full house, it's generally best to raise or bet as there's an excellent chance that you'll win the hand.

# 5 easy tips for learning which hands to play in poker 

In poker, the hands you play will have a significant impact on your ability to win money. While it is natural to want to play every hand, this is not always the best strategy. In fact, playing too many hands can actually lead to decreased profits and increased losses. 

Luckily, there are five easy tips that can help you determine which hands to play in poker: 

Tip #1: Play premium hands

The first tip is to always play premium hands. These are hands that are strong enough to potentially win the pot without any help. Some of the most popular premium hands include aces, kings, queens, and jacks. 

If you do not have one of these premier hands, it is usually best to fold and wait for a better opportunity. Remember, the goal is to win money, and playing weak hands will only put you at a disadvantage. 

Tip #2: Play suited connectors

The second tip is to play suited connectors. These are two hole cards of the same suit that are close in rank. For example, if you have an 8♣ and a 9♣, you would be considered to have a suited connector. 

Connectors can be very powerful if played correctly because they give you the chance to make a straight or flush draw. In addition, they typically have lower odds than other types of hands, making them less risky to play. 

Tip #3: Beware of overplaying top pair


One of the most common mistakes that novice players make is overplaying top pair. This occurs when a player has a pair with the highest card on the board. While top pair can be strong, it is not always wise to bet or raise with this hand. 

There are several reasons for this: firstly, there is always a chance that someone has a better pair; secondly, there is also the possibility of someone having a higher-ranked card than your pair; and finally, there is the chance that somebody could have hit a straight or flush draw. In light of these risks, it is usually best not to bet or raise too much with top pair. 

Tip #4: Watch out for drawing plays

Another common mistake made by novice players is making drawing plays. This happens when somebody decides to chase after cards in an attempt to make a better hand. While this can occasionally lead to success, it is generally not advisable because of the high risk involved.

# Which hand is best to play in Poker?

There are a lot of different opinions on which hand is the best to play in poker, but there is no definitive answer. It really depends on the situation and the players involved.

Some people believe that playing the strongest hand possible is always the best strategy, while others think that it's better to fold sometimes and wait for a stronger hand. There is no right or wrong answer, and it often comes down to personal preference.

There are a few general tips that can help you make the best decisions when it comes to playing hands in poker:

-Playing too tight can be just as bad as playing too loose. You want to be aggressive when appropriate, but also be willing to fold when you don't have a strong hand.

-Try to figure out your opponent's tendencies. If they tend to fold a lot, then you may want to bluff them more often. If they are aggressive players, then you'll need to be more conservative with your hand selection.

-Think about the odds of hitting your desired card combination. If the odds are against you, then it's usually not worth risking your chips by staying in the hand.

-Be patient and wait for good hands rather than playing marginal hands just because you're feeling impatient. There are plenty of opportunities for big wins if you wait for the right moment.
