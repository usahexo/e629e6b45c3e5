#  Record-breaking payout for blackjack in Monaco!

On January 26th, 2018 a blackjack player at the Casino de Monte Carlo in Monaco hit a record-breaking payout of nearly €8.5 million! The lucky gambler, who has remained anonymous, was playing a version of the game with six decks of cards and an obligatory side bet on Lucky Ladies. When the fortunate player’s hand came up as 21, their winnings for the night amounted to an incredible €8,488,620!

This isn’t the first time that someone has walked away from the Casino de Monte Carlo with an impressive pay day. In fact, over the years there have been several big winners at this establishment. Back in 2009 a Norwegian man hit a jackpot worth nearly €7 million while playing roulette. And in 2012 another lucky gambler won €6.2 million by playing blackjack.

So what is it about this particular casino that seems to attract so many big payouts? One reason could be the glamour and luxury associated with Monaco itself. This small country on the French Riviera has long been a playground for the rich and famous, and its casinos are some of the most lavish in the world. The Casino de Monte Carlo is no exception, with its marble floors and ornate chandeliers. It’s no wonder that so many people are drawn to it in hopes of striking it rich!

#  Huge payout for blackjack player in Monaco casino!

A blackjack player hit a jackpot at the Casino de Monte-Carlo in Monaco on Saturday, taking home more than €1.2 million (£1 million/$1.3 million) after playing for just 10 minutes.

The unidentified player was enjoying a game of blackjack at the casino's high roller table when they landed the massive windfall. The lucky winner was playing with a €10,000 (£8,600/$11,000) chip when they hit 21 on their first hand, netting them a payout of €120,000 (£101,000/$131,000).

According to reports, the player then went on to win another three hands in quick succession, banking an additional €360,000 (£305,000/$396,000). In total, the gambler walked away with just over €1.2 million after playing for just 10 minutes.

A spokeswoman for the Casino de Monte-Carlo told reporters that Saturday was a particularly lucky day for their players, with another punter also winning big at the roulette table. "It was a very good day for our customers," she said. "We are always delighted when one of our clients wins big."

The Casino de Monte-Carlo is one of Europe's most famous gambling venues and is popular with high rollers from around the world. The luxurious casino is housed in a former palace and offers a range of classic games such as blackjack, roulette and baccarat as well as more modern slots and video poker machines.

#  Blackjack pays out more than expected in Monaco casino

A recent study by the University of Oxford has found that the blackjack tables in Monaco’s iconic Casino de Monte Carlo pay out more than expected. The study, which was conducted over an eight-month period, took into account over 400 million hands played at the casino.

While blackjack generally has a house edge of around 1.5%, the study found that players in Monaco can expect to earn an average return of 2.24%. That’s 20% higher than in other leading casinos around the world!

What accounts for this higher payout rate? One possible explanation is that casino staff in Monaco are more likely to offer favourable blackjack rules to players, such as doubling down on any number and splitting pairs up to three times.

Casino de Monte Carlo is one of the most famous casinos in the world and has been attracting players since it opened its doors in 1856. While it may not offer the biggest jackpots or the best promotional deals, its Classic Blackjack game remains one of the most profitable in the business.
