#  WACS announces partnership with major online sportsbook

The World Association of Cricket Statistics (WACS) is proud to announce a new and exciting partnership with one of the world’s preeminent online sportsbooks.

This partnership will afford cricket fans around the world access to the most comprehensive cricket betting odds available, as well as a host of other exclusive features.

In addition to betting odds, the new partnership will also see WACS provide its massive database of cricket statistics and analytics to the online sportsbook. This will include detailed data on players, teams and matches across all formats of the game.

Fans can look forward to enjoying enhanced betting experiences thanks to this ground-breaking new partnership. They can also expect faster, more accurate scores and updated stats across all formats as soon as they become available.

Commenting on the new partnership, WACS President Andy Kerr said: “We are very excited to be teaming up with such a well-respected and highly esteemed online sportsbook. This alliance represents a major step forward for both organisations and we look forward to working together closely in order to provide an unrivalled experience for cricket fans around the world.”

#  WACS to offer regulated sports gambling within member states

The World Assembly of Colonies and States (WACS) has announced plans to offer regulated sports gambling within its member states. The move is expected to provide a new revenue stream for the organization, while also helping to protect consumers.

Under the new system, WACS member states will be able to operate casinos and betting shops that offer sports gambling. The organization will also establish regulations governing how the gambling industry operates. This will include rules on minimum age requirements, responsible gambling measures, and consumer protection measures.

WACS Chairman Damien Moore said that the move would help to “boost our economy and protect our citizens”. He added that the organization was committed to ensuring that the gambling industry was “safe and responsible”.

Sports gambling is currently legal in a number of WACS member states, including Australia, Canada, and the United States. However, the industry is largely unregulated, which has led to concerns about consumer protection.

Several WACS member states are considering legalizing sports gambling in order to boost tourism. For example, Sri Lanka is looking at legalizing online sports betting in order to attract more visitors from countries such as India.

#  Record-breaking revenues for online sports gambling in WACS

A report released this week by the World Association of Competitive Sport (WACS) has shown that the online sports gambling industry is booming, with record-breaking revenues being generated in the past year.

According to the report, the global online sports gambling market was worth an estimated $24.5 billion in 2016, and is forecast to grow at a rate of over 10% per year over the next five years. This is largely due to the increasing popularity of digital betting channels, which are seen as more convenient and user-friendly than traditional land-based sportsbooks.

The WACS report also highlights some of the key drivers of growth in the online sports gambling market. These include the increasing availability of digital platforms, rising levels of disposable income among consumers, and ongoing innovation in product offerings.

In particular, there has been strong growth in so-called “in-play” betting – where bets can be placed on events as they are happening – thanks to improved technology that allows for real-time streaming of sporting contests. This has helped to fuel a surge in interest in sports betting among millennials, who are seen as a particularly important target segment for the industry.

Looking ahead, the WACS report notes that regulatory uncertainty could present a challenge for the industry in some markets. However, it expects overall growth to continue thanks to rising demand from consumers and ongoing innovation by operators.

#  WACS members unite to form common sports betting platform

In a landmark development for the sports betting industry, the World Association of Casino Supervisors (WACS) has announced the formation of a common sports betting platform. The new platform will allow members of the WACS to offer a comprehensive range of sports betting products, including pre-match and in-play betting, across multiple jurisdictions.

The platform will be powered by cutting-edge technology from SportsLabs, the world’s leading supplier of sports betting software. SportsLabs has developed a sophisticated modular system that will enable WACS members to quickly and easily launch new sports betting products and services.

Commenting on the news, WACS President Pascal Couderc said: “This is a very exciting development for the WACS and for the sports betting industry as a whole. Our members are some of the most experienced and respected operators in the business, and I am confident that they will make great use of this new platform.”

SportsLabs CEO Gregory Minihan added: “We are very pleased to be working with the WACS on this important project. We believe that our technology will help WACS members to maximise their potential in the global sports betting market.”

#  WACS to crackdown on illegal online sports gambling

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has announced a crackdown on illegal online sports gambling, vowing to take stronger action against websites that allow users to bet on the outcomes of matches.

In a statement issued on Tuesday, WADA Director General David Howman said the organisation would work with governments and law enforcement agencies around the world to "shut down these illegal operations".

"Illegal online gambling is a significant threat to the integrity of sport and WADA will not stand by while its athletes are cheated out of their hard-earned victories," he said.

Howman added that while some online gambling was legal and regulated, "the overwhelming majority is not" and warned athletes and sports organisations to be vigilant about the dangers of illegal betting.

"It is important that everyone involved in sport understands the risks and takes steps to protect themselves from being cheated or influenced by those seeking to fix matches," he said.

The announcement comes as WADA prepares for its annual conference in Johannesburg next week, during which it is expected to announce a number of new measures aimed at tackling doping in sport.
