If you want to win at poker, it’s important to understand which hands are the best and play them accordingly. The five best hands in poker are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Royal Flush</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the best hand in poker – a royal flush is made up of an Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten all of the same suit. It’s a very rare hand and when you do get it, you’re practically guaranteed to win the pot.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Straight Flush</li>
</ol>
<p>A straight flush is made up of five consecutive cards of the same suit. This is a very strong hand and can often beat a royal flush.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Four of a Kind</li>
</ol>
<p>Four of a kind is made up of four cards of the same rank. This is a very strong hand that can often beat two pair or even a full house.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Full House</li>
</ol>
<p>A full house is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. This hand can beat two pair or trips, but usually loses to four of a kind.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Flush</li>
</ol>
<p>A flush is made up of five cards all of the same suit, but not in sequence. This hand can beat any other hand except for a straight flush or royal flush</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-Poker-The-Best-Five-Hands-to-Start-With"><a href="#How-to-Play-Poker-The-Best-Five-Hands-to-Start-With" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Poker: The Best Five Hands to Start With"></a>How to Play Poker: The Best Five Hands to Start With</h1><p>The best poker hands to start with are the following five:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ace-King</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ace-Queen</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ace-Jack</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ten-Queen</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ten-Jack<br>Each of these hands has a high probability of winning, and they are relatively easy to play. Let’s take a look at each one in more detail.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ace-King: This is a powerful hand that can be played in a number of ways. If you are faced with an all-in bet, you can often call and hope to get lucky on the river card. Another option is to raise preflop to try and scare your opponents away.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ace-Queen: This is another strong hand that can be played aggressively or conservatively, depending on the situation. If you are up against two or three opponents, you may want to play conservatively and only bet when you have a good chance of winning. However, if you are playing against one opponent, you may want to raise preflop to try and take down the pot right away.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ace-Jack: This hand is also very versatile and can be played in different ways depending on the situation. You may want to raise preflop when playing against multiple opponents, but you may also want to just call or even fold if there are better hands out there. It’s important to remember that this hand is not always the best, so use your judgement when deciding how to play it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ten-Queen: This hand is a bit weaker than some of the others, but it still has a lot of potential. If you are up against multiple opponents, it’s usually best to just call or fold; there are better hands out there than this one. However, if you are playing against one opponent, it may be worth raising preflop in order to take down the pot right away.<br>5 Ten-Jack: This is another hand that should be played cautiously against multiple opponents, but it can be raised preflop when playing against a single player for maximum effect .</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Poker-Hand-Rankings-–-What-are-the-Winning-Hands"><a href="#Poker-Hand-Rankings-–-What-are-the-Winning-Hands" class="headerlink" title="Poker Hand Rankings – What are the Winning Hands?"></a>Poker Hand Rankings – What are the Winning Hands?</h1><p>A poker hand is made up of five cards. The rank of the poker hand is determined by the combination of the five cards. The higher the rank, the more likely it is that the player will win.</p>
<p>There are 52 potential cards in a deck, so there are 2,598,960 unique five-card hands. Here is a list of the ten most common hands, from best to worst:</p>
<p>Royal flush: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten – all of the same suit.</p>
<p>Four of a kind: Four cards of the same rank.</p>
<p>Straight flush: Five consecutive cards all of the same suit.</p>
<p>Flush: Any five cards of the same suit.</p>
<p>Full house: Three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank.</p>
<p>Three of a kind: Three cards of the same rank.<br>Two pair: Two different pairs of cards.<br>One pair: One card with one rank and three with another rank. </p>
<p>The ace can be high or low in a straight (A-2-3-4-5), but it cannot be both at once (e.g., K-Q-J-10-9 would not be considered a straight). If two players have hands with the same rank, then the kicker decides who wins (the highest card that is not part of the matching rank).</p>
<h1 id="Discover-Which-Poker-Hands-Win-Most-Often"><a href="#Discover-Which-Poker-Hands-Win-Most-Often" class="headerlink" title="Discover Which Poker Hands Win Most Often"></a>Discover Which Poker Hands Win Most Often</h1><p>There are 40 possible combinations of two cards in poker. But which ones are the most successful?</p>
<p>We took a look at 10 million online poker hands to find out. The results may surprise you!</p>
<p>Read on to discover the top 5 poker hands and learn what makes them so successful.</p>
<p>#1. Aces (especially Aces and Kings) </p>
<p>Aces are the most successful poker hand, followed by Kings. This is largely due to the high value of these cards. When combined, they have a total value of 10. In addition, Aces are also strong because they can be used as both high and low cards in a hand, giving players more flexibility when betting.</p>
<p>#2. Pair of Jacks or Better </p>
<p>Pairs of Jacks or better rank second on the list of most successful hands. This is because pairs offer the chance to make a full house, which is one of the most lucrative hands in poker. When playing with a pair, be sure to watch out for higher-ranking pairs such as Queens or Kings, as these can easily overtake your hand.</p>
<p>#3. Two Suited Cards </p>
<p>Two suited cards rank third on the list of most successful hands, mostly because they have a good chance of making one of several different kinds of flush draws. If you happen to be holding two suited cards and there are four or five other suited cards on the table, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to make a flush and win the hand.</p>
<p>#4. AK (An Ace and King) </p>
<p>AK is fourth on the list of most successful poker hands, thanks to its high value and its ability to make both high and low hands. When paired with another Ace or King, this hand has a total value of 13, making it very powerful indeed! Just be careful when playing against other players who are holding an Ace or King – they could easily steal your pot!</p>
<p> #5 One Pair  </p>
<p>One pair ranks fifth on the list of most successful hands in poker. While it’s not as strong as some of the other hands on this list, it’s still capable of taking down a pot if played correctly. Make sure you raise with your pair if there’s any competition at the table – that way you can scare off any opponents who might otherwise contend for the hand!</p>
<h1 id="Study-Your-Poker-Hand-Rankings-for-Greater-Success"><a href="#Study-Your-Poker-Hand-Rankings-for-Greater-Success" class="headerlink" title="Study Your Poker Hand Rankings for Greater Success"></a>Study Your Poker Hand Rankings for Greater Success</h1><p>No two poker hands are alike. Even when two players are holding the same cards, the rank and order of those cards still makes a difference in terms of who the better player is. Learning how to read your hand, and understanding the ranking of poker hands can give you a serious advantage while playing.</p>
<p>There are 10 different types of poker hands, starting with the highest ranking hand and working down to the lowest ranking hand. The 10 different types of poker hands are as follows:</p>
<p>Straight flush: This is a hand that contains five consecutive cards all of the same suit. For example, if you had an Ace-2-3-4-5 all of clubs, you would have a straight flush.</p>
<p>Four of a kind: This is a hand that contains four cards of the same rank. For example, if you had four Jacks, you would have a four of a kind.</p>
<p>Full house: This is a hand that contains three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. For example, if you had three Queens and two Eights, you would have a full house.</p>
<p>Flush: This is a hand that contains five cards all of the same suit but not in consecutive order. For example, if you had an Ace-2-3-4-5 all clubs, you would have a flush.</p>
<p>Straight: This is a hand that consists of five consecutive cards not all of the same suit. For example, if you had an Ace-2-3-4-5 (any combination), you would have a straight.</p>
<p>Three of a kind: This is a hand that contains three cards of the same rank and two unmatched cards. For example, if you held three Kings and two Sevens, you would have three of a kind).<br>Two pair: This is when players have two different pairs as their five card hand. For example, if somebody had two Aces and two Tens they would hold Two pair).  </p>
<p>One Pair: This is when players have just one pair as their five card hand. So for example, holding two Sixes would constitute One Pair) </p>
<p>High card: If players don’t have any type of pair or above then the highest card in their individual hand becomes their winning Poker Hand).</p>
